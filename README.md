#About me
Dedicated to propelling digital evolution and harnessing AI for impactful solutions. 🚀 Currently enrolled in a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence program at Dublin Business School. 💻 My professional journey encompasses dynamic roles, starting with consultancy in digital marketing at DESKDOWN, where I managed 25+ clients in MENA regions, handled SEO for diverse brands, and created compelling social media campaigns.

Following this, I founded and directed Toft Men's, a thriving premium sneaker store. 👟 Within a year, we expanded to a second store and cultivated a loyal customer base of 5000+ across India. Specializing in crafting and executing comprehensive digital marketing strategies, I successfully scaled online sales, achieving milestones like opening a second store.

The journey continued at HERBCO Private Limited, where I played a key role in scaling sales by 10x through performance marketing, leading influencer marketing initiatives, and managing e-commerce platforms across various channels.

🌐 My expertise includes SEO, social media marketing, and e-commerce management. Enthusiastic about the convergence of technology and business, I bring a unique blend of technical skills and an entrepreneurial spirit to every challenge.

🎓 Proud alumnus of the University of Calicut, holding a Bachelor's in Computer Applications with an impressive 83% final grade. 📚 Committed to continuous learning, I am currently shaping my future in AI to contribute meaningfully to the evolving tech landscape.

Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate or delve into the fascinating world of AI and digital innovation! 🌐 #DigitalMarketing #AI #Entrepreneurship #TechEnthusiast"
